# DrawingPanel
Original written by Stuart Reges of UW and Marty Stepp.

This is the enhanced and performant version of DrawingPanel (written by me)!

DrawingPanel is a simplified Java drawing window class to accompany Building Java Programs textbook and associated materials.

Quick start: (Inside main method)

```
DrawingPanel panel = new DrawingPanel(width, height);
Graphic pen = panel.getGraphics();

panel.setBackground(Color.GRAY);
```
